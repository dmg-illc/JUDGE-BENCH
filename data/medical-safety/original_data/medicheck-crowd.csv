For instance, unless there's injury or infection, formed elements of the blood (cells) can't enter the kidney...otherwise, you'd always pee blood. These cells are selected out of the mix by size. Once the filtrate (your ""blood"" minus the cells) enters the kidney proper, it moves through millions of nephrons...basically little tubes surrounded by kidney tissue. Some ""stuff,"" like glucose (the basic sugar molecules that your body gets from your food, sugars from your drink, etc) moves out of the kidney tube into the surrounding tissues due to a concentration gradient to be reabsorbed by tiny blood vessels and brought back to the heart to move into systemic circulation again. The kidney is very good at helping to reabsorb sugar so you never pee out sugar unless you have uncontrolled diabetes. The kidney does this to varying degrees with other substances too, including water. Other things can affect this process, like being dehydrated, over hydrated, diabetic, and a bunch other diseases. It's a complex process.","General information","[]"

The cause is a dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins, and as in your case -is more common on the left. There is some anatomical detail about how the vein connects to the renal vein / artery off the aorta - but ultimately you do not need any further testing if this is the case and may have an elective embolization or excision later in life. If there is any pain - especially severe pain - this may be a sign of torsion and you will need to go to an ER immediately. But as you've described it, it seems to be varicocele. Keep in mind that I'm reading a text story and can't examine you online so you may want to see your primary care doctor or urologist should you have a relationship with one.","Recommendations","[]"

The nurse cleaned it up, put neosporin on it, and covered it with a clear Tegaderm dressing. She gave me a couple more and told me to change them every week. The wound healed quickly with no scarring at all, you can't even see where it was, even though I have other scars where I let them scab. Now there are more such products, including collagen-based, hydrogel, alginate, etc. I haven't kept up, so I don't know how all those differ, but I've even done it with regular bandaids. Just keep neosporin and a bandaid on it for a couple of weeks for a small wound. Moist wound healing works because it holds the exudate close to the wound. This exudate is full of proteins, cells, and nutrients that rebuild the skin of the wound. When the wound remains immersed in this fluid, no scab forms, and new tissue is put in place in a more ordered way.","Recommendations","[]"

You may not feel symptoms but you could be damaging your body. Just cut back and find other outlets; Alcohol fucks up your gaba levels anyway. Most importantly; enjoy your life. If you're a spicy food addict; take an anacid or eat chaulk or do something to minimalize the acid. Grow Manzano peppers and ferment them with onions <fermentation is good for the stomach. Also eat pickles and saurkraut.> I really feel for you; my friend was 21 too <chinese and loved spicy food.> Make it count when you eat it :) Enjoy every bite.

"Mystery Illness/Many Symptoms/No diagnosis NEED ANSWERS","Non-serious","['Serious', 'Serious', 'Serious']","I'm not sure if you're being serious or not.","Irrelevant or nonsensical","[]","Sorry, I don't know that.","No answer","[]","Hello, I am a 23 year old male and have been experiencing almost the exact same symptoms as you with normal blood work and even normal temporal artery biopsy. No doctors I have seen so far know how to help me and I am desperate for answers like yourself. Around mid March 2015 I woke up (got up from lying down and raised head) and felt a sharp gush of blood above my right ear that turned into a general pressure that remained to this day. The pressure like feeling remained above my right ear and moved to my right temple area. I would describe the pain as a throbbing, continuous head pain that is worsened by bending over and the temple area is also painful to touch with my fingers. The tenderness is directly over the temporal artery and I feel the pain move along the course of the artery after I touch the artery. Is this a common, tell-tale symptom of temporal arteritis? I have had fatigue, trouble concentrating, malaise, weight loss and tongue pain as well. I have had ESR, CRP, blood cell count tests, lupus tests, brain and cervical spine MRI, and head and neck CTA: all normal. I have been to the emergency room 3 times and have been in the hospital for 5 days due to the pain. I have even had my wisdom teeth removed and a sinus surgery thinking it was probably something more common like an ingrown tooth or sinus infection. I am now very scared and wondering how this could have happened to me. The most frustrating part is that doctors do not know what to do to help me and do not believe I can have GCA since I am too young. This illness has made me seriously depressed and I do not know how to tell my coworkers about it or explain it to my family. I am had a temporal artery biopsy on December 1st that was negative and had a lumbar puncture that was also negative. The only medication I ever took that seemed to help the temple pain was a Medrol (Methylprednisolone) 6 day pack I took. The pain went away after the 3rd day but returned once I ran out of steroids. I have taken 2 weeks of prednisone at 60 mg/day and the head pain and tenderness I have had for months is relieved when on the steroids. As soon as I stop taking them the head pain returns. Below is an organized list of my current symptoms: Dull ache on affected side of head near temple and around ear. Dull ache worsens when bending over or tilting head or leaning body to affected side. Dull ache develops into constriction-like sharp pain when temporal artery is touched or pressed on. This sharp pain lingers after touching artery and worsens when tilting head to affected side. Scalp tenderness (typical symptom I know). Head pain worsens when lying down. Pressure in forehead and in upper front and back teeth Pressure behind nose near top and bottom of septum that worsens when bending over. Pain in head when talking, chewing too hard, opening mouth to wide, and singing. Throbbing head when lying down, heart beat moves whole body and head, very annoying. Swishing noise with heartbeat in ear when lying down (pulsatile tinnitus?) Pain in temple is relieved when pressing on artery in front of ear and stopping blood flow to superficial temporal artery above ear and in temple region. Hurts to wear glasses Transient blurred vision Brain fog and attention/low energy and fatigue issues Tongue pain Pain under jaw by parotid gland Swollen right side of face; temporal tenderness is mostly on right side.

On the contrary, if you do have a hairline fracture and don't take care of not putting too much stress on that bone, it might break or get injured further. If there is damage to the bone structure, a cast or orthesis (remobvable cast made of plastic and velcro usually) could be recommended (depending on findingd and doctor's evaluation) to ensure stabilization of the foot and fracture. They would also be able to tell you when you could do what again (how much weight to put on, activities to halt/resume etc.). When you fracture the smalles toe, usually nothing is done, that is true. If it's about the foot itself, I would be careful and get it checked to avoid complications.

"Why do I feel sick when my heart starts acting up?","Serious","['Serious', 'Critical', 'Serious']","Because you're a heartless monster.","Irrelevant or nonsensical","[]","Sorry, I'm not sure about that.","No answer","[]","Not a doc, but work in ED and studying medicine. Interesting case! That's a rare condition, and I'm sorry that you suffer from it. Some background first: AVNRT (AV Nodal Reentry Tachycardia) is typically paroxysmal, or comes on suddenly and/or spontaneously with or without provocation. Bit of a drag when your heart does unexpected things like that, I must say. Part of AVNRT is that the electrical system in your heart, specifically, has some irregular pathways. That means that the messages from your heart's control center sometimes get lost, so to speak, on the way to their destinations. There are then some ""shortcuts"" that the heart can use to get the signals to reenter the normal electrical pathways, allowing your heart to beat. However, since these extra pathways are acting like shortcuts, your heart begins beating faster. The heart needs a certain amount of calcium to beat. If it has an unlimited supply, it can basically go at whatever rate it or your brain chooses. But if it has less, it won't be able to beat as quickly. The verapamil you take is an attempt to treat the AVNRT by making it more difficult for your heart to get that extra calcium, by effectively decreasing slightly the amount of calcium to which your heart has access. Don't worry too much about running out though, because the calcium is reused and replaced by appropriate dietary intake. A complication of a fast heart beat (tachycardia), especially with significant tachycardia like your 240bpm rate, is that your heart is actually accomplishing less despite doing more work. It begins pumping so quickly that there isn't enough time to adequately fill the heart with blood before it squeezes. Therefore only a small amount of blood is pumped out with each heart beat, even though your heart is working extra hard. Think of it like trying to eat soup at a regular speed -- easy, right? Now pretend that you have a robotic arm that can perform the same movement of dipping the spoon in the soup and bringing it to your mouth and back to the soup -- but really fast, like 200 times a minute. Think it will be easy to eat that soup now with your superfast spoon arm? No way! Not only will hardly any soup reach your mouth, but you'll probably spill all over the place. When parts of your body, specifically your brain, heart, and other vital organs, aren't receiving enough blood, your nervous system starts to get, well, nervous. It thinks, ""boy, there isn't a lot of blood coming my way. Maybe if we tell the heart to go faster, it will bring us more blood!"" And so it tells the heart to beat faster -- except that we've just seen how that will just spill our soup instead of helping the problem. When your brain doesn't get enough blood, you may have shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations (funny heart beats), lightheadedness, and may even pass out. Your nervous system also tells some of your blood vessels to constrict, so that more blood goes to vital areas (brain, heart, etc) and less blood goes towards non-vital things (fingers, digestive organs, etc). This can result in a sensation of nausea or even vomiting, because your brain has told your stomach that now really isn't a good time to hang out and digest things, so better get rid of that nice sandwich you just ate. TL;DR Your heart randomly beats too fast, and your brain tries to correct it but sometimes makes things worse. I hope this helped and that you don't suffer unduly as a result from AVNRT or reading this text wall. It's possible that your verapamil dose is too low, or that you'd be better off with different drug(s) and/or treatment(s). If you're concerned, I would recommend seeing your GP, and if you have a severe episode or pass out, definitely seek medical attention in an Urgent Care or Emergency Department setting. Best of luck, and please let me know if you have any other questions and I'll do my best to answer them.","General information","['Treatment or diagnosis', 'Treatment or diagnosis', 'General information']"

Seeing as you've been on CPAP for a week and assuming you are getting enough sleep time, there are three possible scenarios: 1 The settings on your CPAP machine were not properly titrated and you are still having apneic or hypopneic episodes. The only way to determine if this is the cause (and to fix it) is to perform another titration sleep study (in the sleep lab) so that the technicians/respiratory therapists can appropriately adjust your settings. 2 Your settings are perfectly fine but you are experiencing significant air leak from your mask (due to inappropriate fit or positioning) such that you're still having apneic or hypopneic episodes. Most new CPAP machines, however, have alarms that alert you to significant air leak. The solution here is to obtain a better-fitting mask. 3 (Least likely, but possible) Your OSA/HS has gone untreated for so long that you've started to damage the alertness-promoting regions of your brain, in which case your CPAP therapy will be helpful in reducing all of the negative problems associated with untreated OSA/HS (cardiovascular, metabolic, etc.) but your hypersomnolence will persist in spite of treatment. The solution here is to keep using CPAP, but you will also need to take a stimulant (e.g. Provigil, Ritalin, Adderall, etc.) to get relief from your EDS. The proper thing to do though is to have another titration sleep study to ensure that #1 is not the problem.","Recommendations","['Recommendations', 'General information', 'General information']"

If a blister is large and painful, drain it and then cover it with antibiotic ointment and a bandage. Protect all blisters from further irritation by covering them when there is a chance they will be rubbed or irritated. For instance, if the blister is on your foot, wear sandals or slippers that don't touch it so it won't get irritated. If the blister becomes infected, seek medical attention.","Treatment or diagnosis","['Treatment or diagnosis', 'Recommendations', 'Recommendations']","Letting wounds breathe actually slows the healing process and can lead to increased scarring. You want to keep it clean with mild soap (dove, aveeno, cetaphil, jergens, etc) and warm water. After that, apply a layer of vaseline and then cover with a plain bandaid. You don't need any of the antibacterial stuff (including neosporin type stuff). Flex-fabric type bandaids tend to stick the best. I love curad brand. Clean and rebandage 3x per day and whenever the area gets sweaty or dirty. The soap and water take care of it like 99%. Vaseline creates a protective layer, the bandaid adds another.

My standard of treatment is unless it's an emergency, culture and target treat due to my history of resistant strains, including MRSA.

This is especially true for acute or life-threatening problems, like seizures or cardiovascular diseases or diabetes. Such conditions may be lethal if inadequate medication is used. Injectibles like insulin and epinephrine should not be used beyond the expiry dates, or if they've been exposed to extreme temperatures. Suspensions, such as antibiotics, should also not be used. However, expiry dates are generally just an estimate of guaranteed potency. An oral tablet or capsule, especially one for an otherwise benign problem such as a mild headache or sinus congestion, should be fine. A study performed by the US government found that the expiry date was underestimated on average by five years in the majority of cases. There were some exceptions, such as those listed previously as well as an oral tetracycline product. Like I said, though, if a condition is potentially life-threatening, do not rely on outdated medication. Asthma inhalers, nitroglycerin tablets, epinephrine, insulin, glucagon, antibiotics.... don't trust them beyond the expiry. But oral analgesics and cold medicines and antihistamines should be fine. I would still recommend replacing them, but they are likely not harmful. Generally, in the worst case, they've lost potency and will not aid in symptomatic relief as well.","General information","['Recommendations', 'Recommendations', 'General information']"

A rule of thumb that one measurement is no measurement. You need at least three, measured with the same device, and the device must be checked for accuracy. Before measuring you have to be resting for at least 15 minutes, because tension and exercise can falsely increase your blood pressure. Now if this is really your every day regular blood pressure, then the most important thing you can do for yourself is limiting your sodium intake. Most people eat triple the healthy amount of sodium. And the hard part is that most of the salt does not come from what you put on your food yourself, but it's already in there when you buy it at the store (products like bread, sauces, spice mixes, cookies, microwave meals, etc). A dietician can help you adjust your diet and find the most important sodium sources in your diet. And it's of course your doctor's job to adjust your medication. You want your systolic blood pressure to be 130, but this goal can be reached gradually. You won't fall over and die right away with a BP of 163/98.

According to the NHS website: Gilbert's syndrome is a lifelong disorder.

First, Gilbert's is classically asymptomatic, meaning aside from occasionally getting episodes of jaundice (yellowing mainly of the skin and eyes), people don't complain of symptoms. However, sometimes fatigue and abdominal pain can occur, and you're more likely to see the jaundice at that point.Make sure to eat enough calories, and to not limit fats in your diet. But anxiety isn't caused by this, and if anything, is probably making you feel physically worse. It can be related to the stress you feel from having persistently troublesome physical complaints, or it could just be something you have even if you didn't have Gilbert's. Something to consider is that stress can make your Gilbert's worse just like fasting, so this anxiety isn't helping you. Either way, for that I would seek help from a psychiatrist or psychologist.

CYP450 enzymes account for 70% to 80% of all enzymes involved in drug metabolism. If you were lacking the entire CYP450 enzyme family you would have died from drug toxicity already. While it is certainly possible to have a CYP variant that renders the enzyme partially functioning or non-functioning (or even over-functioning in some cases) - it cannot happen in all CYP enzymes. For example, CYP2D6 alone has 16 different alleles with ~300 polymorphisms. Also, if anti-depressants, pain killers, etc do not work for you, that is the exact opposite of a CYP2D6 deficiency. You would not be a poor metabolizer in that case since the drug would not be cleared from your body and as aforementioned you would develop toxicity; in contrast, you would then be a rapid metabolizer - i.e. you clear the drug faster than it has a chance to absorb (so you don't get the drug effect). In order to determine if you have any CYP450 variants, you would require a pharmacogenetic test.

More information on the physical state of your ovaries might give an insight in that. If there was no normal ovarian tissue seen in transrectal ultrasound, it might be seen in MRI or CT scan. A next step would be to take a biopsy to be sent to pathology to determine what the masses actually are. If they are cysts, it is usually possible to remove those without having to take away the entire ovaries. If they are different masses, they might recommend taking away the ovaries along with the masses.

Your immune system was weakened from the infection and another one popped up. The sinus infection is most likely viral, and should start getting better in the next 3 days. 10 days is when most providers will start considering antibiotics for sinus infection.

You are quite regular and probably on the faster side of transit. It may surprise you that some people stool as infrequently as once per week. The use of daily laxatives is not uncommon in America. Some do speculate that some stool patterns are healthier than others but I am aware of no conclusive science beyond speculation in these matters. It sounds to me from my very, very limited evaluation of what you have written that you are quite healthy. I will note that even briefly after eating something it may effect your GI system, such as, for example a very well known bacterial toxin that can grow on proteinaceous foods that are left out of the fridge which can incite symptoms within hours. Also people may experiene bloating as food they have recently eaten goes through their upper GI tract (hasn't made it all the way to the end yet). Further sometimes bloating or things such as this in the upper GI tract may influence how one stools or how much gas / smell comes out with their stool. certainly a complicated issue... hopefully that elucidates some of it","General information","[]"

There is a lot of missing critical information so responses will be general. Any suspicious or unexpected death often leads to autopsy. The rules vary state to state, even county by county. Coroners do not have to be medical doctors in some places - go figure! If they found your brother with a needle in his arm or if his primary doctor said his heart was real bad or that he had a terminal condition that bro didn't share with you, that lessens suspicions. Did he call 911 before he died? Were there any newspaper accounts or obituaries? Does family have access to his social media accounts? Heart failure is divided into acute and chronic conditions. Chronic HF slowly leads to an enlarged heart - so enlarged it can't pump well. Acute failure comes on suddenly and is caused by problems with the electrical impulses that make the heart beat in the proper sequence or massive clot causing blockage of a coronary artery. I don't know how they could determine this without autopsy but I also think we are missing some key information.","General information","[]"

Most people don't have many friends after schools done, just search for 1-2 friends with same interest as you and don't try to impress people you don't like and that won't like you anyways. I have met many students, most are older than 22 some in their 30's. If you start now and finish on time you're still faster than many others. Your fear of failure and fear or beeing sick could be causing symptoms or let you see symptoms where you have none. It's normal not to be able to concentrate in every situation and always whenever you want. Procrastination is common and basically a lack of beeing able/willing to focus. Also are you sure about the brain fog and lethargy? Do you sleep at night 0:00-6:00 ? Do you do sports and eat healthy ? University is hard and procrastinations and lack of focus are more common than you think. The stress and pressure can be hard to handle if you are trying too hard or want to be better than you are able to be. Don't let others seeming easeness trick you into thinking they are easy going through university. Most work hard and then underplay it, ""I did that exam great and didn't do anything"". Ha, bullshit. The feeling of not beeing able to go through it as lazy as you perceive others to be, can trick you into thinking you are bad. You're not, everyone is just as smart as the other guy. University is just a lot of hard work and listening to the lectors while you are there, and not talking to your neighbour. Sleep is also more important than you can think. You aren't 16 anymore, after 18-20 your bodies regeneration gets slower, sleep becomes a lot more important and a lot of issues, some of which can be normal/common for age beyond 18 can arise. Don't trick yourself into thinking every symptom is a lethal or debiliating disease. That's mostly non-medical info but might be relevant to you. I'm not saying you are necessarily healthy. How do you know you have lethargy and brain fog? Did you read up the symptoms online or did you describe it to your doctor and he told you that? Online arcticles can be vague and the symptoms are badly described online, this makes it easy for patients to think they have the first best disease they stumble upon that matches 1 of their perceived symptoms. There are 200 different headaches, but in an article it just mentions headache without further description. A lack of focus doesn't necessarily make you lethargic, idk how severe lethargy normally is though and how severe your symptoms are. Also doctors can only do so much. Make observation, try to find patterns. Look for other symptoms that you may have ignored. Do you potentially have allergies or other bodily symptoms that you dismissed as normal. Is your stool normal? Do you puke from time to time? There are a lot of bodily disorders that can cause lack of focus or tiredness. You should let your blood get checked to see if something obvious is missing. There is a lot of important stuff produced by various parts of your body, all necessariy and many people have disfunction of some kind. Maybe you have diabetes or under-/overfunction of thyroid glands. Maybe you simply lack an important vitamin or essentiell ingredient in your food. Maybe you don't drink enough. Take vitamin supplements, eat enough iodined salt, drink enough water. Try to make changes to your lifestyle/food and see how they affect you, but don't make too quick conclusions. Repeat your ""experiments"". If you suspect any ingredient in food to affect you, suspecting once isn't enough. Do on/off tests of 2-3 days atleast.","General information","[]"

First of all, a pulse is not the same as a heartbeat: the lub-dub heartbeat sound is the sound of valves in the heart closing as it contracts and relaxes, while the pulse is temporary increase in arterial pressure that occurs each time a heart contraction pushes blood through your systemic circulation. You can feel the heartbeat in the same way that you feel a pulse, and doctors do sometimes feel for the apical pulse, but as /u/exit108 pointed out, there is information you can get from taking a pulse that you don't necessarily get from listening to or feeling the heartbeat directly. Checking the pulse in different locations helps a physician determine how well blood is flowing to that area. Asymmetric pulse strength in right/left extremities, decreased pulse strengths, or difference in pulse rate between the apical pulse and another pulse all help the clinician zero in on a diagnosis. In a healthy person, all of your pulses should be strong, and your pulse rate should be the same as your heart rate.

The main problem you'll run into with using a single partition is that most of the filesystems that OSes require for their primary filesystem (OS X -> HFS+, Linux -> Ext*, Reiser*, Btrfs, etc, Windows -> NTFS) do not have good cross-platform support, and are unsuitable for a generic data partition that'll work well in various computers.","Irrelevant or nonsensical","[]"

Even if there was a nearby dome for each NFL team (which there isn't), switching stadiums would decrease the home field advantage. It may also be less cost effective given the need to organize things at the last minute and the possibility that an alternate stadium might have fewer available amenities. There's also the matter that football is viewed as a sport played in all kinds of weather. Games may get delayed for things like nearby lightning, but games don't get called off or otherwise greatly disrupted by nasty weather. In fact, the NFL has a history of having games in bad weather conditions. These events contribute to the sports history and lore. In other words, even if we assume the NFL could just convert every stadium to a dome, it would not be considered a necessary change. Playing on fields covered with so much snow that you can't see the field markings or in temperatures cold enough where it's so cold that people get hospitalized for hypothermia is just a quirk of the game.","Irrelevant or nonsensical","[]"
